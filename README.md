# Faceid-for-2018-MacBook-Pro
I added Face ID to a Mac that doesn't have Face ID.


Using Automator, I ran a shell script that, upon the Macbook waking up, would open a window that scans someone's face, cross-referencing it with a photo of the desired face. Upon recognition, this window will close.
